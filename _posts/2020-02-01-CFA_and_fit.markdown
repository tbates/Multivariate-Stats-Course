### CFA and concepts of fit

This week we will introduce the concept of good model fit and how it is estimated.

1. Parameters in the model
2. degrees of freedom
3. χ²(df)
4. AIC
5. DIC
6. TLI
7. CFI
8. RMSEA


*Curb your enthusiasm*: By this week, you should understand how a factor analysis can have many explanatory variables (factors) as there are things measured (items or variables), and that these can be oriented in arbitrary ways.
