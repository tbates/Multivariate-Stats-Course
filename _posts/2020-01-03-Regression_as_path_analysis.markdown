### Path Analysis: Regression and lm as a subset of SEM

This week we will leverage the modelling you already know by building the equivalent of `lm(y ~ x + z)` in `umx` package.

This builds on two ideas you already understand: Factor analysis and linear models/ANOVA.</li>

*Curb your enthusiasm*: By this week you should understand what boxes, circles, triangles, diamonds, and straight and curved arrows are. 


### Introduces
 * The idea of causality, testing (and, critically, mxCompare()-ing) ideas. And use real tasks, such as handling a ordinal outcomes as thresholded normals.
 * **Tutorial**: Specific SEM models
