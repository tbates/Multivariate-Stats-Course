### Week One

Overview of the next 5 weeks of [MV stats](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/15-16/dpt/cxpsyl11054.htm)

1. **Factor analysis**
2. Structural Equation Modelling
3. CFA
4. Path Analysis
5. Latent variable modeling

Introduces you to the idea of latent variables, the concept of a path diagram, and also how to do a factor analysis in R.

Show how the EFA needs to fix latent variances at 1 and covariances at 0, and fix the upper right triangle of whatever matrix contains the latent loadings.

Show what rotation does (R is great for that - just pull the loadings matrix and throw in at promax() or varimax().

Introduce indeterminacy by talking about how the rotations do not differ in fit.

**Next week**: We will convert this model to CFA. Use a real data set so it has a purpose.
